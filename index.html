        <p>You find yourself awakening in utter darkness, unable to even glimpse your own hands. Out of nowhere, a soft glow flickers nearby. Drawn to it, you notice the light is not only shifting but also emitting eerie sounds, much like a door's creak. Do you cautiously move closer to the light, or stay put and watch?</p>
