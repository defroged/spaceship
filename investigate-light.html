        <p>Taking a deep breath, you muster the courage to inch closer to the mysterious light, each step slow and deliberate. As the glow becomes clearer, it reveals an unexpected sight: a robot the size of a stool, its metal surface gleaming under the faint luminescence. In its grip, it clutches a small monitor. Just below the screen is a keypad, adorned with worn-out numbers. The robot is repeating the same words - "What number? Type number"</p>
